  <h1>
    Are the Grades Up To Snuff? DOH Behind on City Health Inspections
  </h1>

  <div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
      Data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene shows that many restaurants in the up and coming Murray Hill/Kips Bay Area are awaiting results on their health Inspections.

    <p>
      Let's be real, no one wants to eat at a gross restaurant. It's bad enough that we've been forced to hide away from the world because of a deadly virus, I don't want to worry about any hair in my food. When the NYC health department implemented the ABCeats program they promised to do away with this concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABCeats is the letter grading system the city uses to categorize the general cleanliness of an establishment. A health inspector comes into the establishment and inspects the area for infractions. Each infraction results in points added. Infractions can be anything from improperly washed kitchen equipment to finding vermin on-premises. The number of points is dependent on the severity of the infraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the city had shut down in 2020 inspections were still happening. Althought a noticeable dip had occured, most restaurants have been graded and favorably at that. In Community District 6, 90% of restaurants  inspected receieved an A ranking.
